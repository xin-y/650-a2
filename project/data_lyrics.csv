we call them cool.those hearts who have no scars to show.the ones that never do let go.and risk the tables being turned..we call them fools.who have to dance within the flames.who chance the sorrow and the shame.that always comes with getting burned..but you got to be tough when consumed by desire.'cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire..we call them strong.those who can face this world alone.who seem to get by on their own.those who will never take the fall..we call them weak.who are unable to resist.the slightest chance love might exsist.and for that forsake it all..they're so hell-bent on giving.walking a wire.convinced it's not living.if you stand outside the fire..standing outside the fire.standing outside the fire.life is not tried, it is merely survived.if you're standing outside the fire..there's this love that is burning.deep in my soul constantly yearning to get out of control.wanting to glide higher and higher.i can't abide standing outside the fire..standing outside the fire.standing outside the fire.life is not tried, it is merely survived.if you're standing outside the fire..standing outside the fire.standing outside the fire.life is not tried, it is merely survived.if you're standing outside the fire;0
ain't it just like one of us.to pick up the phone and call after a couple drinks.and say how you been, i've been wondering if.maybe you've been thinkin' about me.and somewhere in the conversation.an old familiar invitation always arrives.i may hate myself in the morning.but i'm gonna love you tonight..everyone's known someone that they.just can't help but want.even though we just can't make it work out.the want to, lingers on.so once again, we wind up in each other's arms.pretending that it's right.and i may hate myself in the morning.but i'm gonna love you tonight..i know it's wrong, but it ain't easy movin' on.so why can't two friends.remember the good times once again..tomorrow when i wake up.i'll be feelin' a little guilty, a little sad.thinkin' how it used to be before everything went bad.i guess that's what it is.all lonely, late night calls, that we try to find.i may hate myself in the morning.but i'm gonna love you tonight.i may hate msyelf in the morning.but i'm gonna love you tonight;0

turn the scissors with open blades.all the darkness will burn.recalling pictures of olden days.all these feelings return.if you're breathing you've been afraid.in the shadows remain.i'll be stalking you night and day.till you share all my pain..now we step into the fire..beware you will pay.ladykiller.i swear you will pay.ladykiller..bait the killer and lie in wait.till the morning unfolds.now he's feeding on my mistakes.and the trail has run cold.all the violence that fills the world.leaving nothing for shame.this is when so much pain will call out.such things i have learned..hear my vow and fear my vengeance..beware you will pay.ladykiller.i swear you will pay.ladykiller.'"`uniq4421475e4d2d07cd-lyrics-00000001-qinu`"';0

o they tell me of a home far beyond the skies.and they tell me of a home far away.o they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise.o they tell me of an uncloudy day..o the land of cloudless day.o the land of an unclouded sky.o they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise.o they tell me of an uncloudy day..o they tell me of a home where my friends have gone.and they tell me of that land far away.where the tree of life in eternal bloom.sheds its fragrance through the uncloudy day..o the land of cloudless day.o the land of an unclouded sky.o they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise.o they tell me of an uncloudy day..o they tell me of a king in his beauty there.and they tell me that mine eyes shall behold.where he sits on the throne that is whiter than snow.in the city that is made of gold..o the land of cloudless day.o the land of an unclouded sky.o they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise.o they tell me of an uncloudy day..o they tell me that he smiles on his children there.and his smile drives their sorrows all away.and they tell me that no tears ever come again.in that lovely land of uncloudy day..o the land of cloudless day.o the land of an unclouded sky.o they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise.o they tell me of an uncloudy day;2

cuando tú estás conmigo,.es cuando yo digo.que valió la pena.todo, todo lo que yo he sufrido. ..no sé si es un sueño aún.o es una realidad,.pero cuando estoy contigo es cuando digo:.que este amor que siento.es porque tú lo has merecido,.con decirte amor que otra vez he amanecido.llorando de felicidad;.a tu lado yo siento que estoy viviendo.nada es como ayer. ..abrázame que el tiempo pasa y él nunca perdona,.ha hecho estragos en mi gente como en mi persona..abrázame que el tiempo es malo y muy cruel amigo,.abrázame que el tiempo es oro si tú estas conmigo, ..abrázame fuerte, muy fuerte, más fuerte que nunca,.siempre abrázame. ..hoy que tú estás conmigo,.yo no sé si está pasando el tiempo o tú lo has detenido.así quiero estar por siempre,.aprovecho que estás tú conmigo.te doy gracias por cada momento de mi vivir ..tú cuando mires para el cielo,.por cada estrella que aparezca amor es un "te quiero". ..abrázame que el tiempo hiere y el cielo es testigo.que el tiempo es cruel y a nadie quiere por eso te digo: ..abrázame muy fuerte amor, manténme así a tu lado.yo quiero agradecerte amor todo lo que me has dado,.quiero corresponderte de una forma u otra a diario;.amor yo nunca del dolor he sido partidario,.pero a mí me toco sufrir cuando confié y creí.en alguien que juró que daba su vida por mi. ..abrázame que el tiempo pasa y no se detiene,.abrázame muy fuerte amor que el tiempo en contra viene,.abrázame que dios perdona, pero el tiempo a ninguno,.abrázame que no le importa saber quien es uno,.abrázame que el tiempo pasa y él nunca perdona.ha hecho estragos en mi gente como en mi persona,.abrázame que el tiempo es malo y muy cruel amigo.abrázame muy fuerte amor.;3
voy a jugarme un albur.con una baraja de oro.que si lo gano ya estuvo.y si lo pierdo ni modo.porque yo soy de los hombres.que cuando pierdo no lloro..las mujeres son barajas.que hay que saber barajear.pa saber cual es la suya.di la que vas a apostar.no ya despues de perdido.quieras volver a jugar..y si juegas sin malicia.porque no les tienes miedo.esperando a sota de oros.se aparece un caballero.dispense mi buen amigo.esque yo lleguo primero..el que no lo quiera creer.que le entre a lo pantera.pierde dinero y mujer.y hasta la portamonedas.y a veces llega a su casa.con la camisa de fuera..y ni modo de reclamos.porque yo llego a caballo.estoy regando el rosal.pa cortar la flor de mayo.perdoneme rey de copas.pero yo soy de a caballo..y si juegas sin malicia.porque no les tienes miedo.esperando a sota de oros.se aparece un caballero.dispense mi buen amigo.esque yo lleguo primero;3
siento un vacio que va.ahogandome una vez mas.te quema el aire en la piel.y vivir me da igual...me duele tanto saber.me duele solo pensar.que moriremos asi y de igual forma te vas.tus palabras me pueden mentir.tu mirada jamas...contra viento y marea.y tal vez contra el mundo.luchare con quien sea.sin dudar un segundo.con todo el corazon.a matar o morir.contra viento y marea por estar junto a ti...llevo un silencio que da.la sensacion de gritar...tengo la mente en tu voz.que pide nunca olvidar.tus palabras me pueden mentir.tu mirada jamas..contra viento y marea.y tal vez contra el mundo.luchare con quien sea.sin dudar un segundo.con todo el corazon.a matar o morir."contra viento y marea por estar junto a ti"..con un sueño que pide.con mi fe que te sigue.y con todo el amor.(coro).con todo el corazon.a matar o morir.contra viento y marea por estar junto a ti..junto a ti;3

en algun lugar de un gran pais.olvidaron construir.un hogar donde no queme el sol.y al nacer no haya que morir….y en las sombras.mueren genios sin saber.de su magia.concedida, sin pedirlo.mucho tiempo antes de nacer..no hay camino que.llegue hasta aqui.y luego prentenda salir.con el fuego de.el atardecer arde la hierba..en algun lugar de un gran pais.olvidaron construir.un hogar donde no queme el sol.y al nacer no haya que morir….un silbido cruza el pueblo.y se ve, un jinete.que se marcha con el viento.mientras grita.que no va a volver..y la tierra aqui.es de otro color.el polvo lo debe saber.los hombres ya no.saben si lo son.pero lo quieren creer.las madres que ya.no saben llorar.ven a sus hijos partir.la tristeza aqui.no tiene lugar.cuando lo triste es vivir;3
la huasteca esta de luto.se murio su huapanguero.ya no se oye aquel falsete.que es el alma del trovero...rogaciano se llamaba.rogaciano el huapanguero.y era sones de la sierra .las canciones del trovero...la azucena y la cecilia.lloran, lloran sin consuelo.malaguena salerosa.ya se fue su pregonero...el canal esta en su punto.hoy comienza la molienda.el trapiche esta de duelo.y suspira en cada vuelta...por los verdes cafetales.mas alla de aquel potrero.hay quein dice que de noche.se aparece el huapanguero...la azucena y la cecilia.lloran, lloran sin consuelo.malaguena salerosa.ya se fue su pregonero;3

yo sé bien que estoy afuera.pero el día en que yo me muera.sé que tendrás que llorar..llorar y llorar.llorar y llorar..dirás que no me quisiste.pero vas a estar muy triste.y así te vas a quedar..con dinero y sin dinero.hago siempre lo que quiero.y mi palabra es la ley.no tengo trono ni reina.ni nadie que me comprenda.pero sigo siendo el rey..una piedra del camino.me enseñó que mi destino.era rodar y rodar..rodar y rodar.rodar y rodar..después me dijo un arriero.que no hay que llegar primero.pero hay que saber llegar..con dinero y sin dinero.hago siempre lo que quiero.y mi palabra es la ley.no tengo trono ni reina.ni nadie que me comprenda.pero sigo siendo el rey;3
a donde te hayas hermosisimo lucero.a quien estas iluminándole la vida.mientras que yo aquí sin ti soy mula sin arriero.muerta de sed por los caminos de la vida..quisiera ser aquella nube pasajera.para buscarte en lugares que me ofendes.quisiera estar en donde estas ahorita mismo.para arrancarte de los brazos en donde duermes..tu eres el sol con que se alumbra mi existir.tu eres el agua con que se apaga mi sed.tu eres el aire que respiro pa vivir.tu eres la tierra donde al fin descansare..si me emborracho pa olvidarte ni te olvido.es que en el fondo de mi copa te estoy viendo.y en el fondo de la copa tu te burlas.con esa risa que me mata el pensamiento..tu eres el sol con que se alumbra mi existir.tu eres el agua con que se apaga mi sed.tu eres el aire que respiro pa vivir.tu eres la tierra donde al fin descansare;3

fue un placer amarte, fue un placer tenerte.fue un fino regalo estar a tu lado por todo este tiempo.no te merecía por eso te has ido.de cualquier manera gracias por las noches que pase contigo..fue un placer robarme besos a tus labios.me sentí importante cuando caminamos.juntos de la mano..gracias por sus clases divina maestra.he sido expulsado de su corazón.juro que me pesa..fue un placer mirarte sin ese vestido.esos ojos lindos como primavera.aun no los olvido..fue un placer morirme porque te quedaras.no merezco tanto por eso mi amor.te brotaron alas..fue un placer robarme besos a tus labios.me sentí importante cuando caminamos.juntos de la mano..gracias por sus clases divina maestra.he sido expulsado de su corazón.juro que me pesa..fue un placer mirarte sin ese vestido.esos ojos lindos como primavera.aun no los olvido..fue un placer morirme porque te quedaras.no merezco tanto por eso mi amor.te brotaron alas;3

hope dangles on a string like slow spinning redemption.winding in and winding out, the shine of it has caught my eye.and roped me in, so mesmerizing and so hypnotizing.i am captivated, i am..vindicated, i am selfish, i am wrong.i am right, i swear i'm right, swear i knew it all along.and i am flawed but i am cleaning up so well.i am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself..so clear like the diamond in your ring, cut to mirror your intention.over-sized and overwhelmed, the shine of which has caught my eye.and rendered me so isolated and so motivated.i am certain now that i am..vindicated, i am selfish, i am wrong.i am right, i swear i'm right, swear i knew it all along.and i am flawed but i am cleaning up so well.i am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself..so turn up the corners of your lips.part them and feel my finger tips.trace the moment, fall forever..defense is paper-thin.just one touch and i'll be in.too deep now to ever swim against the current..so let me slip away, so let me slip away.so let me slip away, so let me slip against the current.so let me slip away, so let me slip away.so let me slip away, so let me slip away..vindicated, i am selfish, i am wrong.i am right, i swear i'm right, swear i knew it all along.and i am flawed, but i am cleaning up so well.i am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself..slight hope dangles on a string like slow spinning redemption;3

parece que alguien te contó que me han visto llorando .no pudiste creerlo .viniste a comprobarlo. ..que aquel que algún día te pidió por favor te marcharas .hoy daría hasta el alma .por que tu regresaras. ..es de humanos el equivocarse y pedir perdón .(aunque a veces duele más aceptarlo) .pero creo que yo he cometido mi peor error. .ni juntando todas las tristezas de mi corazón... .había llorado así .había sufrido así .siento que moriré sin ti ..nunca jamás había llorado así .y estoy sufriendo como nunca antes sufrí .y estoy pagando gota a gota cada lágrima de sangre desde el día en que .te vi partir. ..nunca jamás sentí tanto dolor .es un puñal clavado aquí en mi corazón .que me desgarra lentamente y me consume .porque no tengo tu amor. ..es de humanos el equivocarse y pedir perdón .(aunque a veces duele más aceptarlo) .pero creo que yo he cometido mi peor error. .ni juntando todas las tristezas de mi corazón... .había llorado así .había sufrido así .siento que moriré sin ti. ..nunca jamás había llorado así .y estoy sufriendo como nunca antes sufrí .y estoy pagando gota a gota cada lágrima de sangre desde el ía en que .te vi partir. ..nunca jamás sentí tanto dolor .es un puñal clavado aquí en mi corazón .que me desgarra y me consume poco a poco .porque no tengo tu amor. ..siento que me estoy muriendo .por la falta de tus besos .nunca había llorado así... ..estoy pagando gota a gota cada lágrima de sangre desde el día en que te vi partir. .y ya no aguanto esta pena y así no puedo vivir ..y así no se puede vivir .un corazón sin ti, mi corazón sin ti se que se va a morir. ..vuelve .que el dolor me mata y no quiero perderte ..pobre diablo! .te han dicho que me han visto en la calle llorando.;3
pardon me you left your tears on the jukebox.and i'm afraid they got mixed up with mine.i don't mean to pry it's just that i noticed you, goin' out of your mind.it look like we're two of a kind..let's fall to pieces together.why should we both fall apart.let's fall to pieces together.right here in each other's arms..alone is much better together.when the worst is still yet to come.so let's share the rest of the tears that are left.from two hearts that just came undone.why should we go crazy alone..let's fall to pieces together.why should we both fall apart.let's fall to pieces together.right here in each other's arms..let's fall to pieces together, right here, in each other's arms;3
take the ribbon from my hair.shake it loose and let it fall.laying soft against your skin.like the shadows on the wall..come and lay down by my side.'til the early morning light.all i'm taking is your time.help me make it through the night..i don't care what's right or wrong.and i won't try to understand.let the devil take tomorrow.'cause tonight i need a friend..yesterday is dead and gone.and tomorrow's out of sight.and it's sad to be alone.help me make it through the night..and it's sad to be alone.help me make it through the night.i don't want to be alone.help me make it through the night;3
i rushed home from work like i always do.i spent my whole day just thinking of you.when i walked through the front door, my whole life was changed.'cause nobody answered when i called your name..a note on the table that told me goodbye.said you'd grown weary of living a lie.oh, your love has ended, but mine still remains.but nobody answers when i call your name..oh, the lonely sound of my voice calling.is driving me insane.and just like rain, the tears keep falling.but nobody answers when i call your name..oh, the lonely sound of my voice calling.is driving me insane.and just like rain, the tears keep falling.but nobody answers when i call your name.oh, nobody answers when i call your name;3

i'd like to see you in the morning light.i'd like to feel you when it comes tonight.now i'm here and i'm all alone.still i know how it feels.i'm alone again..tried so hard to make you see.but i couldn't find the words.now the tears, they fall like rain.i'm alone again without you.alone again without you.alone again without you.alone again without you..i said stay, but you turned away.tried to say that it was me.now i'm here and i've lost my way.now i know how it feels.i'm alone again..i...;3
come on yeah!..i've been looking so long for you now you won't get away from my grasp.you've been living so long in hiding in hiding behind that false mask.and you know and i know that you ain't got long now to last.your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past..you're standing in the wings there you wait for the curtain to fall.knowing the terror and holding you have on us all.yeah, i know that you're going to scratch me and maim me and maul.and you know i'm helpless from your mesmerizing cat call..keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait.don't you stray, don't fade away.watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may.don't you stray from the narrow way..i'm running and hiding in my dreams you're always there.you're the phantom of the opera, you're the devil, you're just out to scare.you damaged my mind and my soul it just floats through the air.you haunt me, you taunt me, you torture me back at your lair..you torture me back at your lair;3
down at the astoria the scene was changing.bingo and rock were pushing out x-rating.we were the first band to vomit in the bar.and find the distance to the stage too far.meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'clock.rock is dead they say.long live rock..long live rock, i need it every night.long live rock, come on and join the line.long live rock, be it dead or alive..people walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving.we put on our makeup and work out all the lead-ins.jack is in the alley selling tickets made in hong kong.promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone.back in the pub the governor stops the clock.rock is dead, they say.long live rock..long live rock, i need it every night.long live rock, come on and join the line.long live rock, be it dead or alive..landslide, rocks are falling.falling down 'round our very heads.we tried but you were yawning.look again, rock is dead, rock is dead, rock is dead..the place is really jumping to the high-watt amps.'til a 20-inch cymbal fell and cut the lamps.in the blackout they dance right into the aisle.and as the doors fly open even the promoter smiles.someone takes his pants off and the rafters knock.rock is dead, they say.long live rock, long live rock, long live rock..long live rock, long live rock, long live rock.long live rock, long live rock, long live rock..long live rock, i need it every night.long live rock, come on and join the line.long live rock, be it dead or alive;3

el era un hombre de campo.oriundo de nuevo león.tenía apenas 19 años.su nombre: josé pérez león...tenía un primo lejano.que de mojado se fue.al poco tiempo le envió un telegrama.diciendo ven pronto josé...pues un trabajo le habían encontrando.piscando algodón como él...y se fue, y se fue.ahogando en llanto en el adiós.con su mujer.se fue, sin saber.que de ese viaje ya jamás iba a volver.pobre josé...cuando llegó a la frontera.con willy se entrevistó.era el  pollero más afamado.y astuto de la región.le dijo pepe hoy estás de suerte.mañana te cruzo yo.....la madrugada de un viernes.en una vieja estación.20 inocentes pagaban su cuota.entre ellos josé pérez león.y sin dudarlo a todos subieron.en el interior de un vagón...el tren cruzó al otro lado.casi 7 horas después.fue cuando el aire empezó a terminarse.y ya nada pudieron hacer.nadie escuchó aquellos gritos de auxilio.y la puerta no quiso ceder...uno por uno se fueron cayendo.y asi falleció el buen josé...y se fue, y se fue.a cruzar el cielo con sus ancias de crecer.se fue, sin saber .que ya su esposa un hijo suyo iba a tener.pobre josé...así termina la historia, no queda más que contar.de otro paisano que arriesga la vida.y que muere como ilegal.de aquel josé que mil sueños tenía y que a casa.jamás volvera...;3
sometimes i feel like i am drunk behind the wheel.the wheel of possibility, however it may roll.give it a spin, see if it can somehow factor in.you know there's always more than one way.to say exactly what you mean to say..was i out of my head? was i out of my mind?.how could i have ever been so blind?.i was waiting for an indication.it was hard to find.don't matter what i say, only what i do.i never mean to do bad things to you.so quiet that i finally woke up.if you're sad then it's time you spoke up too..was i out of my head? was i out of my mind?.how could i have ever been so blind?.i was waiting for an invitation.it was hard to find.don't matter what i say, only what i do.i never mean to do bad things to you.so quiet but i finally woke up.if you're sad then it's time you spoke up... too;3
new york snow this time of year.there's nothing more beautiful to me.except for you.making my way uptown and down.seeing familiar places and faces.in my pile of coffee grounds..the days are better, the nights are still so lonely.sometimes i think i'm the only cab on the road.sometimes i think i'm the only cab on the road..watching my breath rise in the sun.pulling myself in to make one.hopelessly feel for my phone and drive away.this new rhythm i pursue.is just my getting over you.or telling myself that i need to..the days are better, the nights are still so lonely.sometimes i think i'm the only cab on the road.sometimes i think i'm the only cab on the road..i'm still looking for a fare.no one said that it was fair....to be alone..the days are better, the nights are still so lonely.sometimes i think i'm the only cab on the road.the days are better, the nights are still so lonely.sometimes i think i'm the only cab on the road.sometimes i think i'm the only cab on the road.;3
lying in my bed i hear the clock tick,.and i think of you.caught up in circles.confusion is nothing new.flashback warm nights.almost left behind.suitcases of memories.time after.sometimes you picture me.and i'm walking too far ahead.you're calling to me, and i can't hear.what you've said.then you say go slow.i fall behind.the second hand unwinds.if you're lost you can look, you will find me.time after time.if you fall i will catch you i'll be waiting.time after..my picture fades and darkness has.turned to gray.watching through windows you're wondering.if i'm ok.secrets stolen from deep inside.the drum beats out of time..if you're lost you can look, you will find me.time after time.if you fall i will catch you i'll be waiting.time after time.mmm...;3

con un llanto empieza el baile.de la vida sin que alguien.te explique como es..en un mundo al revez.donde lo unico seguro.siempre es un tal vez..anda sin avanzar.guardando de a poquito.el tiempo en el ayer..remando río arriba.cada noche, cada día.sabiendo que..hay un amor afuera.que espera por ti.la sangre se acelera.lo que queda es salir..hay un amor afuera.que espera por ti.no tardes tanto nena.que voy a morir..caminando en la corniza.entre la rabia y la risa.se va la juventud..detrás de un cielo azul.que se quedo en fotografías.dentro de un baúl..un barco en baja mar,.volver de la oficina.a punto de llorar..pero la luna llena.que una noche desempeña.en recordar..que hay un amor afuera.que espera por ti.la sangre se acelera.lo que queda es salir..hay un amor afuera.que espera por ti.no tardes tanto nena.que voy a morir...cada cual tiene un boleto.que nos lleva.lejos de la soledad..hay un amor afuera.que espera por ti.la sangre se acelera.lo que queda es salir..hay un amor afuera.que espera por ti.no tardes tanto nena.que voy a morir;3

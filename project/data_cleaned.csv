sometimes i feel like i am drunk behind the wheel the wheel of possibility however it may roll give it a spin see if it can somehow factor in you know theres always more than one way to say exactly what you mean to say  was i out of my head was i out of my mind how could i have ever been so blind i was waiting for an indication it was hard to find dont matter what i say only what i do i never mean to do bad things to you so quiet that i finally woke up if youre sad then its time you spoke up too  was i out of my head was i out of my mind how could i have ever been so blind i was waiting for an invitation it was hard to find dont matter what i say only what i do i never mean to do bad things to you so quiet but i finally woke up if youre sad then its time you spoke up too,3
new york snow this time of year theres nothing more beautiful to me except for you making my way uptown and down seeing familiar places and faces in my pile of coffee grounds  the days are better the nights are still so lonely sometimes i think im the only cab on the road sometimes i think im the only cab on the road  watching my breath rise in the sun pulling myself in to make one hopelessly feel for my phone and drive away this new rhythm i pursue is just my getting over you or telling myself that i need to  the days are better the nights are still so lonely sometimes i think im the only cab on the road sometimes i think im the only cab on the road  im still looking for a fare no one said that it was fair to be alone  the days are better the nights are still so lonely sometimes i think im the only cab on the road the days are better the nights are still so lonely sometimes i think im the only cab on the road sometimes i think im the only cab on the road,3
lying in my bed i hear the clock tick and i think of you caught up in circles confusion is nothing new flashback warm nights almost left behind suitcases of memories time after sometimes you picture me and im walking too far ahead youre calling to me and i cant hear what youve said then you say go slow i fall behind the second hand unwinds if youre lost you can look you will find me time after time if you fall i will catch you ill be waiting time after  my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray watching through windows youre wondering if im ok secrets stolen from deep inside the drum beats out of time  if youre lost you can look you will find me time after time if you fall i will catch you ill be waiting time after time mmm,3

con un llanto empieza el baile de la vida sin que alguien te explique como es  en un mundo al revez donde lo unico seguro siempre es un tal vez  anda sin avanzar guardando de a poquito el tiempo en el ayer  remando río arriba cada noche cada día sabiendo que  hay un amor afuera que espera por ti la sangre se acelera lo que queda es salir  hay un amor afuera que espera por ti no tardes tanto nena que voy a morir  caminando en la corniza entre la rabia y la risa se va la juventud  detrás de un cielo azul que se quedo en fotografías dentro de un baúl  un barco en baja mar volver de la oficina a punto de llorar  pero la luna llena que una noche desempeña en recordar  que hay un amor afuera que espera por ti la sangre se acelera lo que queda es salir  hay un amor afuera que espera por ti no tardes tanto nena que voy a morir  cada cual tiene un boleto que nos lleva lejos de la soledad  hay un amor afuera que espera por ti la sangre se acelera lo que queda es salir  hay un amor afuera que espera por ti no tardes tanto nena que voy a morir,3
no me preguntes por qué a veces la nombro por casualidad y es que aún la recuerdo y es que aún llevo dentro su forma de amar  una razón para ti me pides motivos y una explicación para no desterrarla ahora y para siempre de mi corazón  yo soy así y seguiré vagando errante por tu piel yo no podré dar todo de mí mientras no olvide a esa mujer  y sigo esclavo de sus besos y sigo preso de mis miedos hemos llegado a un punto de inflexión en el que esta obsesión está apartándome de ti y sigo esclavo de sus besos y sigo preso de mis miedos y sigo sin saber por qué razón sigue ella en mi interior y en nuestro punto de inflexión y sigo esclavo de sus besos  no hay quien controle el amor de hecho te quiero como a nadie a más pero a veces es ella la que me derrumba mi seguridad  yo soy así y seguiré vagando errante por tu piel yo no podré dar todo de mí mientras no olvide a esa mujer  y sigo esclavo de sus besos y sigo preso de mis miedos hemos llegado a un punto de inflexión en el que esta obsesión está apartándome de ti  y sigo esclavo de sus besos y sigo preso de mis miedos y sigo sin saber por qué razón sigue ella en mi interior y en nuestro punto de inflexión y sigo esclavo de sus besos  yo no podré dar todo de mí mientras no olvide a esa mujer  y sigo esclavo de sus besos y sigo preso de mis miedos hemos llegado a un punto de inflexión en el que esta obsesión está apartándome de ti y sigo esclavo de sus besos y sigo preso de mis miedos y sigo sin saber porqué razón sigue ella en mi interior y en nuestro punto de inflexión y sigo esclavo de sus besos  y sigo esclavo de sus besos,3
standing with my enemies hung on my horns with haste and reverie killing with charm  only happy when you hurt only deadly in a swarm only healthy in the dirt only empty in your arms  i play im sick and tame drawing the hordes i wait and show the lame the meaning of harm the skulls beneath my feet like feathers in sand i graze among the graves a feeling of peace  only bending when you break only feeding when youre cold only healing when you ache and only feeling when you dont,3
dont wanna take it slow i wanna take you home and watch the world explode from underneath your glow  i wanna watch the way you creep across my skull  you slowly enter cause you know my room and then you crawl your knees off before you shake my tomb  i wanna watch you close i need to see for sure after the tape is through who do you think we can show  i wanna watch the way you creep across my skull  you slowly enter cause you know my room and then you crawl your knees off and then you shake my tomb  i wanna watch the way you creep across my skull  you slowly enter cause you know my room and then you crawl your knees off before you shake my tomb  you enter slowly you know my room you crawl your knees off and then you shake my tomb,3

cierro los ojos sin mirar atrás las cosas buenas pasan más y más y tus errores tienen la virtud de hacerme mal  hasta he intentado escapar de aquí pero me cuesta renunciar a ti parece ser que voy del norte al sur una vez más  algo de ti esta acabando conmigo algo de mi se esta muriendo contigo cada minuto se convierte en un siglo y cada sitio es un espacio vacío algo sin ti es nada y pierde el sentido porque sin ti vivir no es más que un castigo es como un barco que navega perdido yo solo quiero rescatar rescatar lo perdido  a veces pienso que esto es el final que no hay motivos para continuar pero yo siento que te quiero aun incluso más  y si me quieres para que pensar mientras tú piensas la vida se va mañana es tarde para regresar a este lugar  algo de ti esta acabando conmigo algo de mi se esta muriendo contigo cada minuto se convierte en un siglo y cada sitio es un espacio vacío algo sin ti es nada y pierde el sentido porque sin ti vivir no es más que un castigo es como un barco que navega perdido yo solo quiero rescatar lo perdido  algo de ti esta acabando conmigo algo de mi se esta muriendo contigo cada minuto se convierte en un siglo y cada sitio es un espacio vacío algo sin ti es nada y pierde el sentido porque sin ti vivir no es más que un castigo es como un barco que navega perdido yo solo quiero rescatar rescatar lo perdido,3
una palomita blanca de piquito colorado ayer yo la vi llorando en las cumbres de un guayabo  currucu currucu le cantaba el palomito currucu currucu que volviera a su nidito  blanca palomita vuela vuela por esa pradera aquí te estaré esperando aunque de dolor me muera  currucu currucu le cantaba el palomito currucu currucu que volviera a su nidito  en las cumbres del guayabo muy lejos del palomar ahí estaba la paloma llorando sin descansar  currucu currucu le cantaba el palomito currucu currucu que volviera a su nidito,3
sólo una palabra se hubiera llevado el dolor con el beso amargo de aquel licor hubiera bastado mi amor sólo una mentira se viene conmigo a pasear sentirme querida en aquel abrazo en el mar  con el vestido azul que un día conociste me marcho sin saber si me besaste antes de irte te di mi corazón y tú lo regalaste te di todo el amor que pude darte y me robaste he rasgado mi vestido con una copa de vino hoy tu amor corta como el cristal  en el cielo hay playas donde ves la vida pasar donde los recuerdos no hacen llorar vienen muy despacio y se van sólo una caricia me hubiera ayudado a olvidar que no eran mis labios los que ahora te hacen soñar  con el vestido azul que un día conociste me marcho sin saber si me besaste antes de irte te di mi corazón y tú lo regalaste te di todo el amor que pude darte y me robaste he rasgado mi vestido con una copa de vino hoy tu amor corta como el cristal buena suerte en tu camino yo ya tengo mi destino con mi sangre escribo este final,3
